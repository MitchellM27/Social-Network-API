# Social Network API

## Task: To create a program that works as a networking API locally.
* Goal: To create a dynamic API that allows the user to add, update, and delete users, thoughts, friends, and reactions.
* Specifications: The program must make the use of the flexibility within MongoDB to create interconnecting models. A User, Thought, Friends, and Reaction component must be fully functional and they must work together to show how Mongoose populates foreign objects into different sections.
* Points of Emphasis: This program will exhibit knowledge in Javascript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. It will exhibit the MVC structure and the separate components of this program will work together to produce the back end program. 
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning application including the necessary files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the video of the working application is shown here:
